- A component is a javascript function that takes in props.
Since classes ARE functions in js, classes also can be components in react

ie. const MyFirstReactComponent = props => {
    return <div>My First React Component</div>
}

-Reusability let components do one thing really well. Single Responsibility Principle. Every component does only one thing so it does it really well.

-start by defining the bare minimum the component needs to have in order to function
-don't over style the component. it's easier to pass in props that trigger classNames for styles
-don't nest too deep
-use defaultProps when building a default component that can stand alone.
